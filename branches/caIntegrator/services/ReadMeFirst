*** ATTENTION: Please be aware that Introduce 1.2 was used to create and modify services.***

** 
  To avoid multiple duplications of jar files in services lib directory, those jar files are moved into Common/lib directory
**


if checking out from svn, directory path structure should be similar to this:

.../bioconductor/trunk/services/
                          |                
          caDNAcopy   caPROcess   Common  build.xml   ReadMeFirst                           
           |     |         |          |
       caGrid    R
         |
     CaDNAcopy
	   
** Common directory which contains jars needed by services and SHOULD BE COPIED to service project lib directory FIRST before doing anything else to a service.  To do so:
       - Grab build.xml
       - run: ant copyLibs -DcagridProj=path_to_project as shown above (for example: ant copyLibs -DcagridProj=caDNAcopy/caGrid/CaDNAcopy)
Or: 
       - Simply copy all jar files under Common/lib to a service lib directory
