*** ATTENTION: Please be aware that Introduce 1.2 was used to create and modify services.***

Path constructor should be similar to this:
.../bioconductor/trunk/services/
                          |                
          caDNAcopy   caPROcess   Common  build.xml                           
              |           |          |
       caGrid     R
         |
       CaDNAcopy
	   
1) Common directory which contains lib files needed SHOULD BE DOWNLOADED FIRST before doing anything else to a service.
2) Get the build.xml
   Note: Run ant -p (or help) to view options available
3) Download available services (like CaDNAcopy, CaPROcess...)
4) Run ant 'option flag' to copy libs from Common to services.
   For example: ant updateCaDNAcopyLibs will copy lib files to approricate places under CaDNAcopy
5) Then, good to go....
