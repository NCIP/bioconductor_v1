Hi Martin,
Sorry about the late response.  I have done a review from the Architecture
side, and it looks good.  Sal has done a cursory review from the VCDE side,
and he mentioned that everything is looking good.  He plans a more in-depth
review over the new few days.
I have copied Pankaj Agarwal to do an Architecture review.   He is a mentor in
training here at Duke.  Consider the model approved from the Architecture
side, though he may have some other feedback that can be incorporated at a
future iteration.
One point to note is that it will be nice to have a class diagram with your
analytical interfaces for the silver-compatibility review.  But, for model
registration this is not necessary.  Also, for your contractual deliverable, I
don't think this is needed (though Juli can confirm).
Thanks,

Hello Martin,
I have not found any glaring errors with your model. You now have your value
domains all straightened up via Claire Wolfe et. al. which was the biggest
problem that I had pointed out previously.
I guess that this means that I officially sign off this model.
Congrats,
-Sal
